Interfacing I2C based LCD Module via I2C Communication protocol.
Note :
1) For LCD to be properly initialized, it should be supplied 5V instead of 3.3V.
2) Addition to that, level shifter should be used to connect SCL and SDA lines of LCD module with I2C Peripheral of STM32. (5V is non-tolerant for STM32F4).
3) External Pull up resistors are not necessary since LCD I2C module has those resistors embedded in it.

SCL--->PB6
SDA--->PB7
