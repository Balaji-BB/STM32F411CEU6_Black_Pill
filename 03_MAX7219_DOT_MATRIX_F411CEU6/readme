Interfacing cascaded Dot Matrix Display(MAX7219 based) using SPI Protocol.
Note :
1) Dot Matrix Display can work with both 3.3V & 5V respectively. But don't forget to use level shifter in case of 5V supply voltage.
2) DMA memory allocation utilized in the code may cause heap overflow in case of sending too much large strings.
